Tradecard is a neo-bank for contractors. We understand the unique financial needs of tradespeople and we are here to help them grow and succeed.

We offer a range of products and services designed specifically for tradespeople, including expense management, invoice financing, loans and insurance so they can spend less time doing admin, and spending more time on the job.

We are committed to providing an outstanding level of service to our customers, as well as supporting the trades community, which operates like a ‘guild’ - an association of professionals who oversee the practice of their craft, supporting each other and the overall agenda of tradespeople
